# Asymmetric Variance: A Six Sigma Approach to Football Analytics
> "Victory is achieved when we operate within Six Sigma reliability (Order), while forcing the opponent into High-Entropy states (Chaos)."
## 📄 Project Overview
This repository hosts the **Asymmetric Variance Framework**, a football analytics methodology that applies **Industrial Engineering, Reliability Engineering (Six Sigma), and Game Theory** to modern tactics. 
The objective is not just to analyze data, but to inject a precise engineering mindset into the sport—moving beyond the fatalistic acceptance of variance.
